# CertificateGenerator
A python script that will generate certificates of events and send mail to the participants just by giving an excel sheet as an input

Firstly by executing the loc_config.py we find the location where the text is to be put by hit and trial
once we have the location 
we use that location in auto_config.py 
we give excel sheet database name and certificate image as the input and execute and also create a directory to store the generated certis
we have to put in the gmail account details through which you want to send mail and configure gmail for allowing less secure apps to access it
once all settings are proper you are good to go
execute the file 
PS i sent around 3000 mails in just a span on 10 mins it so awesome!
